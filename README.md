## For modders

### How to create a mod using QuakeReloaded
1. Setup a project with the Reloaded template. You can find [documentation here](https://reloaded-project.github.io/Reloaded-II/DevelopmentEnvironmentSetup/)
2. In your project, include [QuakeReloaded.Interfaces nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/QuakeReloaded.Interfaces).
3. Edit your ModConfig.json:
   1. Set the `ModID` with the following name convention (remember all lower case and no spaces): `quakeenhanced.mod.<your mod name>`
   2. Add `quakeenhanced.mod.quakereloaded` to `ModDependencies`
   3. Add `quake_x64_steam.exe` to `SupportedAppId`
4. To get access to QuakeReloaded API use the following code in your Mod constructor:
   ```csharp
   if (!(_modLoader.GetController<IQuakeReloaded>()?.TryGetTarget(out var qreloaded) ?? false))
       throw new Exception("Could not get QuakeReloaded API. Are you sure QuakeReloaded is installed & loaded before this mod?");
   ```
5. Refer to [other mods](https://jpiolho.github.io/QuakeReloaded/mods.html) source code and the [QuakeReloaded API documentation](https://jpiolho.github.io/QuakeReloaded/api.html).
